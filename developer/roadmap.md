#4.1 Release#

* ArcGIS Rest integration
* 2D Openlayers implementation?
* Bootstrap layout?
* Automated Windows setup

#Under Consideration#
We have lots of madrona-based apps out in the wild that extend the functionality in some way.  Often these features make the best candidates for inclusion as a core feature.  Currently this includes:

* Simple point drag-drop widget (bioregions)
* Wizard form (bioregions)
