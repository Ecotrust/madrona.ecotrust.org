<p>Support for 2D mapping libraries such as OpenLayers and Leaflet has been added to the Madrona platform.  The key to this was extending the Madrona Feature API to support GeoJSON in addition to KML, allowing you the flexibility to choose a 2D or 3D mapping client for visualization of features.</p>

<p>Other Madrona features such as map bookmarks and the layer manager will also be adding support for 2D mapping clients.</p>
