Earlier in 2012 Madrona was invited as a nominee for the Katerva Awards, recognized as the pinnacle of global sustainability recognition.  Today we discovered that Madrona had successfully made it through their rigorous filtering process to be selected as one of their top 10 Ecosystem Conservation nominees.  Unfortunately, the project did not make it on to be a top 5 finalist but we are humbled by the recognition received and will continue to use and improve Madrona for creating game-changing planning tools in sectors and geographies around the world.
