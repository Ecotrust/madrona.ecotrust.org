After several years of development, we are pleased to announce the first public release of the Madrona platform.  This software
library provides everything a developer needs to create powerful and collaborative spatial planning tools.  Madrona has formed
the core of Ecotrust's applications that support spatial planning work, both marine and terrestrial.  We are ready to inspire others to use it on a much larger scale.
