After months of development, Ecotrust is pleased to announce the first public release of Madrona, version 4.0.  Madrona is the evolution of [MarineMap](http://marinemap.org), a tool for web-based marine spatial planning developed by the MarineMap Consortium which included the University of California Santa Barbara, Ecotrust, and The Nature Conservancy.  MarineMap reached end-of-life with version 3 in 2011.  [Learn more about Madrona's history]({{BASE_PATH}}/experience/history.html)
