I wanted to share a few of the news stories covering the public release of Madrona.  Being a software framework and not a traditional software end-product, it can be hard to explain exactly what Madrona is and the power and flexibility it provides.  The more we talk about it, the better the messaging will get.  We appreciate all of your feedback.

And, if you're curious about what we're doing with mobile with Madrona, read a bit about our Digital Deck project getting underway.  Things are starting to get interesting, stay tuned.
