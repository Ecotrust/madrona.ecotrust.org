Based on your feedback from the workshop last month we've made some updates to the Madrona appliance.  Notable changes include:

* Updated to Madrona 4.0b1 (with GeoJSON output)
* Installed Virtualbox guest additions allowing you to resize the screen and do basic things like copy and paste text between the guest and host.
* Added some niceties to the app initialization process
