		<h1>Technology</h1>
		<h2>Philosophy</h2>
		<div>
			<p>Madrona makes many choices for you while still providing lots of options, so you can get to the fun part of building tools right away.  You, the web developer, are still required to make many choices about your application and Madrona gives you building blocks to piece together the mental model of your solution quickly without getting distracted by all of the nuts and bolts.</p>
			<a name="The-Zen-of-Madrona"> </a>
			<h3>The Zen of Madrona</h3>
			<ul>
			    <li>The best process for making decisions will vary depending on scale, geography and culture.</li>
			    <li>Work directly with the intended users to capture the mental model of your decision-making process</li>
			    <li>Let the mental model define which data layers, spatial features and user actions are needed</li>
			    <li>The spatial features and user actions will define the API</li>
			    <li>The API and its workspace document will drive the client interface</li>
			    <li>Let these conventions be your guide but they should get out of the way when no longer useful</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h2>Core Building Blocks</h2>
		<p>Madrona is built on libraries such as Django, PostGIS, JQuery, OpenLayers and Google Earth which provide all of the essential building blocks for developing modern spatial web applications.</p>

		<p>One-size-fits-all rarely works and often times you have to roll your sleeves up.  The assumption is you will want to integrate different technology with Madrona whether it’s a mapping library like Leaflet, data management and data serving tools like Geoserver or ArcServer or a more robust client-side framework like GeoExt.</p>

		<h2>Architecture</h2>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="span9">
				<a name="Features"> </a>
				<h3>Features</h3>

				<p>Madrona creates a system that can best be thought of as a feature spatial content management system.  This starts with the Madrona PointFeature, LineFeature and PolygonFeature models.  You can quickly extend these models to define your own spatial features specific to the purpose of your tool.  Working with wind energy sites?  Define a PolygonFeature and give it attributes for the type and number of turbines.  Once you register your feature it’s mapped to a PostGIS table and automatically published through the REST API.</p>

				<a name="REST-API"> </a>
				<h3>REST API</h3>

				<p>The madrona <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST API</a> is the communication channel for the client and server and supports both GeoJSON and KML.  Using it you can:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Create, read, update and delete Features</li>
					<li>Copy and share Features between user groups</li>
					<li>Manage Features within a FeatureCollection</li>
					<li>Convert to export formats</li>
					<li>Access reports and related documents</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Workspace Document</h4>

				<p>The workspace document is an important part of the REST API.  It is a JSON document that the client fetches from the server at startup that describes the server-side API.  Specifically::
				<ul>
					<li>What Features are defined for the current user</li>
					<li>What Feature actions are available for the current user</li>
					<li>How Features relate to one another</li>
				</ul>

				Specifically, the workspace document describes the URLs for:
				<ul>
					<li>Creating, Updating, and Deleting Feature instances</li>
					<li>Editing actions that can be performed such as Copying and Sharing</li>
					<li>Managing relationships between Features</li>
					<li>Alternative export formats, such as KMZ or shapefile downloads</li>
					<li>Related files that can be downloaded, such as spreadsheet or pdf reports</li>
					<li>Reading feature attributes or reports</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p>Because the API is well-defined through the workspace document, you can quickly and efficiently develop alternative client interfaces. 
				</p>
				<p>For more information consult the <a href="http://ecotrust.github.com/madrona/docs/workspace_specification.html">Madrona workspace specification</a>
				</p>

				<p>The JSON snippet below defines the wind energy site feature in the workspace document.  You can see that URL's have been published for performing create and edit actions as well as accessing associated viewshed maps and KMZ/Shapefile exports.</p>

			<a name="3D-Web-Client"> </a>
			<h3>3D Web Client</h3>

			<p>By default, madrona provides a robust HTML/Javascript client interface based on the 3D Google Earth plugin. It is not the only option for building a client interface but it does provide a complete solution out of the box.</p>

			<p>The 3D web client allows features to be delivered using the expressive KML format. Using the workspace document the client will automatically configure a set of javascript widgets including the Google Earth Plugin, forming an end-to-end spatial content management system. Besides the Google Earth plugin itself, madrona provides a number of additional components.</p>

			<h4>KmlTree</h4>

			<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/kmltree/">kmltree</a> is a javascript tree widget that can be used in conjunction with the Google Earth API. It replicates the functionality of the Google Earth desktop client, namely the ability to render complex KML documents very quickly and present the hierarchal contents of a KML document as an expandable, interactive tree view.</p>

			<h4>KmlEditor</h4>

			<p>KmlEditor provides the editing interface and menu to hook your features tree into the REST API. It will use the workspace document and configure the editing interface according to the API definition. The interface is context sensitive and provides the appropriate options for the selected features.</p>

			<h4>KML Drawing Tools</h4>

			<p>Madrona provides a robust set of drawing and editing tools for the Google Earth Plugin.  These play a part in the larger workflow of creating, editing and sharing features.</p>

			<a name="2D-Web-Client"> </a>
			<h3>2D Web Client</h3>

			<p>Madrona provides core support for 2D web mapping through its REST API allowing a variety of possibilities for developing 2D client interfaces.  Additional client-side widgets are currently <a href="http://madrona.ecotrust.org/developer/roadmap.html">in development</a> for Madrona.  You can contribute to that effort or take a look at frameworks such as <a href="http://www.geoext.org/">GeoExt</a>.  OpenLayers is currently seen as the most robust 2D mapping client with support for vector editing, UTF-Grid encoding and other advanced features most often needed by Madrona-based tools.</p>

			<h4>GeoJSON Output</h4>

			<p>The Madrona REST API provides support for GeoJSON output of any Feature by default.  This was challenging because the GeoJSON specification does not currently support a hierarchical structure (a collection within a collection) and Madrona does through its <a href="http://ecotrust.github.com/madrona/docs/features.html?highlight=featurecollection">FeatureCollection class</a>.  To get around this Madrona supports two strategies, a ‘flat’ strategy that strictly follows the spec and a ‘nest_feature_set’ strategy which extends the GeoJSON specification to tell you all of the child collections that are within a given collection.  In this way you can quickly query down into an arbitrary hierarchy of features.</p>

  |- collection2

    | - polygon3
