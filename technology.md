		Philosophy
		Madrona was created to make lots of choices out of the box for you while providing lots of options, so you can get to the fun part of building tools right away.  You, the web programmer, are still required to make many choices about your application and Madrona gives you the building blocks you need to piece together your mental model of the problem quickly without getting distracted by the nuts and bolts.  Still, there is no way for any framework to think through the problem for you.  Madrona is the path not the destination.
		The Zen of Madrona

		    Capture the mental model of your decision-making process.
		    Let the mental model define which Features and Links are needed.
		    The Features and Links will then define the REST API.
		    The REST API and its workspace document will drive the client interface
		    Let these conventions be your guide but they should get out of the way when no longer useful.
		    Don’t worry about creating new functionality as a one-off but if you reuse it, then consider generalizing it to a core feature.


		Visit the Madrona Knowledge Base to learn more
		Significant Features
		These are the key building blocks of Madrona.  Most are some combination of Use only what you need.
		Spatial Features

		    Links - Generic views/urls to perform create, read, update, delete, conversion, copying, sharing, etc.(creating, reading, editing, updating, downloading, copying, sharing, etc)
		    Shareable
		    User-created
		    typically discrete geometries but always represented as KML or GeoJSON
		    Collection - contain other features or collections. have their own behaviors, etc

		Data layers
		KML data layers - http://ecotrust.github.com/madrona/docs/layers.html
		Content Management
		Flatblocks
		Collaboration
		Flexible Analysis
		The analysistools module provides a toolkit to standardize interaction with external modeling/analysis software.  http://ecotrust.github.com/madrona/docs/analysistools.html
		Study Regions
		We designed the study region concept as a central component of marinemap/madrona implementations. It is used by default manipulators and to zoom the initial map view. If you want to implement custom zooming mechanisms or custom manipulators, those will occur as customizations at the project code level.  http://ecotrust.github.com/madrona/docs/studyregion.html
		Manipulators
		There are many cases in which a user-defined geometry needs to be modified or cleaned by an automated process. This process can be initiated the user as a tool or context action, or as part of the initial creation of a new feature. Typically, the user is provided an opportunity to review any changes made to their geometry.  Individual manipulators can be applied in series producing the desired output.  Use cases might include:

		    Clipping a shape to your study region
		    Clipping a shape to the shoreline
		    Clipping out exclusion areass


		http://ecotrust.github.com/madrona/docs/manipulators.html
		Import/Export
		Import and export common spatial formats.  You don’t want your tool to be a black box.  Integrates the workflows you have in other GIS and modeling environments.

		http://ecotrust.github.com/madrona/docs/loadshp.html
		http://ecotrust.github.com/madrona/docs/export.html
		Asynchronous Tasking
		Custom Projections

		2D and 3D Support
		Raster Statistics
		The raster_stats app allows you to analyze raster datasets based on a polygon geometry. For example, for a given polygon, you may want to know the average elevation or the maximum temperature, etc. Essentially this performs a vector-on-raster intersection.  The app uses an optional caching mechanism so that any geometry/raster combination only needs to be run once.

		http://ecotrust.github.com/madrona/docs/raster_stats.html
		Architecture
		Core Libraries
		Django
		PostGIS
		GDAL/OGR
		Work with any of the wide range of data formats and databases supported by GDAL and OGR including shapefiles, KML, GeoJSON, CouchDB, Spatialite, Google Fusion Tables, GeoTiff, ESRI Grid, ESRI Geodatabase, Excel, CSV, etc.
		REST API
		Defined bahavior, methods and relationships with other data
		KML
		GeoJSON
		Caching
		Reporting
		Workspace Document
		Actions [Links] (creating, reading, editing, updating, downloading, copying, sharing, etc)
		Helpers

		    Raster Stats
		    Manipulators
		    Async
		    Study Region
		    Public and private data layers

		Client Widgets
		KmlTree
		KmlEditor
		Potential Software Stacks
		All options require the client working with the workspace document.
